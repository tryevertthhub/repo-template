## Signed Message
The following message was signed using the private key:
```plaintext
This is a proof of ownership for my GitHub repository.
```
## Signature
The cryptographic signature for the signed message is stored in `signature.bin`.

## Verification Instructions
To verify the ownership:
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. **Run the Python script run.py:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
3. **`signature.bin`**
This file contains the binary cryptographic signature generated using the private key.

## How to Test this repo?
